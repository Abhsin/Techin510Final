'It's called exhaustion,' analyst says in wake of frenzied rally

Nvidia Corp.'s stock has been nearly invincible lately, and initially seemed on track Friday to log its seventh straight session of gains - before a dramatic reversal lower.

 The last time Nvidia's stock (NVDA) was up at least 5% intraday but ended the session more than 5% lower was June 9, 2017, when it rose as much as 5.4% but finished off 6.5%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

 While shares of chip companies Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) opened Friday's session lower - after their earnings reports last night showed pressure in segments unaffected by artificial intelligence - other chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) saw positive momentum shortly after the open.

 But the broader chip sector moved lower mid-morning, and all 30 members of the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX ended the session in the red for the first time since Jan. 3, according to Dow Jones Market Data. ""

He added that investors should keep in mind that Nvidia and other AI-darling stocks in the chip sector ""cannot trade up every single day,"" as they seemingly and unnaturally have been lately.

2024-03-10,"After watching Apple's defiance of European antitrust regulators this week, I've come to the conclusion that the company needs to face greater antitrust scrutiny. Without this, Epic presumably won't be able to get Fortnite — which lost a ton of revenue when Fortnite was removed from the app stores during antitrust litigation — back into the Apple App Store. “The NFT rules are arbitrary to me.”
  Epic lost to Apple — except on the small point of Apple losing its right to prohibit Epic from steering consumers away from Apple to its cheaper prices in its web store. But in what Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called “ malicious compliance ,” Apple still found a way to impose a 27% royalty on transactions outside the app store.
