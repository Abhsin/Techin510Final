Effect on Today’s Design Engineers

As the industrial manufacturing segment continues to adopt IIoT and M2M technologies, processes and operations can be streamlined, potentially resulting in overall cost savings, predictive maintenance capabilities and better data analytics.

 In the M2M space, growth is attributed to increasing support by the government toward M2M connections and the increasing popularity of smart cities and connected cars, according to a release. Add to that the forecast for global smart factory market size to reach $140.9 billion by 2027, according to the same company’s “Smart Factory Market by Component, Solution, Industry and Region” report, and it is no surprise that today’s multidisciplinary design engineers have had to adapt.
