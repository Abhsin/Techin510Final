2024-03-07,"EU official Thierry Breton said regulators are looking into Apple's termination of a competing app store by Fortnite creator Epic Games. The EU on Thursday said it would look into an ongoing dispute between tech giant Apple and Epic Games, the developer of the popular Fortnite video game franchise.

 ""Under the DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers, European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton wrote on X. ""I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority. EU cracking down on digital 'gatekeepers'

The DMA will put Apple and other big tech companies under growing scrutiny in the coming months. The tech giant says that due to a earlier court decision, ""Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion.""

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told journalists Wednesday that there needs to be ""swift action"" regarding Apple's alleged violation of the DMA.

2024-03-09,"'Never lose site of the finish line.'   Business leaders did this in spades Saturday at SXSW when Ann Hiatt told them about the “DNA” it takes to become a “unicorn leader.”
   As she said via a quote by neuroscientist Dr. Robert Malenka: “Get into rigorous environments that challenge you and will build up a thick skin.”
  5) Unicorn leaders are smart, but in a specific and learned manner
  But Hiatt defined this as being able to “process massive amounts of information, distill it down to unique observations… Here are the 12 keys to being a “unicorn” leader that Hiatt passed along, many of which she learned on the job.
  1) “Agreeableness is a problem for innovation.” And diversity matters not just for inclusion, Hiatt said, but because “future opportunities inevitably lie outside of our current expertise.”
  8) Unicorn leaders understand that you have to challenge your mind.
