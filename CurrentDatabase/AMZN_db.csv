2024-03-08,"From his breakthrough role in ""The Hangover"" to his Oscar-nominated turn in ""Maestro,"" here are the actor's finest films. In the hands of director Paul Thomas Anderson , any actor can be good, but Cooper feels like he walked out of the screen and into reality.
  Where to watch : Amazon Prime Video
   Netflix
  Clint Eastwood 's gritty crime drama (a drop in the actor/director's bucket, truly) sees Bradley Cooper play a DEA agent in a talented ensemble including Laurence Fishburne Michael Peña , and Dianne Wiest . Time will tell if this film will finally earn Cooper an Oscar (and he's up for multiple categories), but even if he doesn't walk away with a trophy, his performance will always be a cornerstone of his formidable career.

   Peter Lindbergh/Warner Bros.
  Bradley Cooper's best performance to date is also his most understated, playing a reserved and disturbed country artist who discovers a show-stopping singer ( Lady Gaga ) and embarks on a doomed love affair. He would of course improve his craft over time, but the absolute charisma Cooper possesses is clear at his career's onset, acting confident and smooth while still being too fresh-faced to do much else.

  Though it got a bad rap, this film about a drug-addicted chef on a redemption arc showcases the core tenets of Cooper's acting approach: he's meticulous, obsessive, and electric. He largely succeeds here, but this is a more serviceable vehicle for Eastwood by way of Eastwood.

   As she said via a quote by neuroscientist Dr. Robert Malenka: “Get into rigorous environments that challenge you and will build up a thick skin.”
  5) Unicorn leaders are smart, but in a specific and learned manner
  But Hiatt defined this as being able to “process massive amounts of information, distill it down to unique observations… Here are the 12 keys to being a “unicorn” leader that Hiatt passed along, many of which she learned on the job.
  1) “Agreeableness is a problem for innovation.” And diversity matters not just for inclusion, Hiatt said, but because “future opportunities inevitably lie outside of our current expertise.”
  8) Unicorn leaders understand that you have to challenge your mind.

 Oracle founder Larry Ellison notched a $15 billion gain on Tuesday after shares of his software company had their best day in over two years and closed at a record.
   “We're building an AI data center in the United States where you can park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center,” Ellison, who still operates as Oracle's chief technology officer, said on the earnings call. While Oracle was late to cloud infrastructure and has been on the fringes of the latest artificial intelligence boom, increased demand for the company's AI technology is allowing Ellison to tout his company's expansion in the hottest market in the industry.
   Over the past year, Oracle shares have now spiked 52%, lifting Ellison's worth by about $50 billion. According to FactSet, Ellison's last transaction in Oracle stock was a purchase of 7,000 shares in 2022, and he hasn't sold any since 2016.
