2024-03-07,"Ed Ludlow  | Bloomberg  Rivian Automotive Inc. is halting plans to build a multibillion-dollar factory in Georgia, an abrupt reversal
aimed at cutting costs while the company prepares to launch a cheaper electric vehicle.
   Rivian, one of the few pure-play EV makers manufacturing in America, is trying to grab market share from Tesla Inc. with the new model, its first aimed at the mass market. Rivian currently makes two consumer plug-in EVs, the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, and a commercial van primarily for Amazon.com Inc., its biggest shareholder. Shifting planned production of the forthcoming R2 model to an existing facility in Illinois will allow Rivian to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026, earlier than expected. Rivian said this model would be priced lower than the R2, without giving a dollar amount or timeline for when it might be built.

 The EV optimism follows more recent Gartner research that estimates electric car shipments will increase 19% in 2024 over last year’s numbers, to a total of 18.4 million. Investors seeking to capitalize on potential growth in the EV market could find great appeal in the KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF (KARS).

2024-03-08,"Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death sparked Canada-India diplomatic row
 Exclusive security video obtained by The Fifth Estate reveals the elements of a highly co-ordinated attack that ended with the killing of a prominent Canadian Sikh separatist.
   The document alleges that just hours after Nijjar was killed on June 18, Gupta sent a video of Nijjar's body to the person he was trying to hire as a contract killer and told him to kill the New York target ""quickly.""
  The fight for an independent Khalistan
  The alleged New York target has since been revealed to be Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual Canadian-American citizen and a staunch ally of Nijjar in the fight for an independent Sikh homeland in northern India to be called Khalistan.
   ""Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar,"" Trudeau said in the House of Commons on Sept. 18.
   As general counsel for the pro-Khalistan U.S.-based group Sikhs for Justice, Pannun is known widely for the videos he posts online in which he makes inflammatory statements about the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including one in which he labels Modi a ""Hindu terrorist.""
  Sikh leaders marked for death
  Pannun believes the non-binding referendums are the reason he and Nijjar became targets of the Indian government.
   The Fifth Estate shows how the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar was carried out
  Sidhu told his friend, Malkit Singh, to chase the two men on foot while he tried to help Nijjar.
