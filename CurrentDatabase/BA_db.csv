 Oracle founder Larry Ellison notched a $15 billion gain on Tuesday after shares of his software company had their best day in over two years and closed at a record.
   “We're building an AI data center in the United States where you can park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center,” Ellison, who still operates as Oracle's chief technology officer, said on the earnings call. While Oracle was late to cloud infrastructure and has been on the fringes of the latest artificial intelligence boom, increased demand for the company's AI technology is allowing Ellison to tout his company's expansion in the hottest market in the industry.
   Over the past year, Oracle shares have now spiked 52%, lifting Ellison's worth by about $50 billion. According to FactSet, Ellison's last transaction in Oracle stock was a purchase of 7,000 shares in 2022, and he hasn't sold any since 2016.
