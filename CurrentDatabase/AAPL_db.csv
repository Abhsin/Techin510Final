 Trends like these undoubtedly contribute to the viewpoint some FIs executives have that faster payments equal higher levels of fraud risk, which might explain their lack of enthusiasm for real- time payments — and open banking. The report, which PYMNTS Intelligence created in collaboration with Hawk AI, reflects responses from 200 FI executives who were asked how fraud trends are shaping their support of open banking generally and, more specifically, real-time payments.

 As the report explains, open banking — the legal framework linking financial data across institutions for use by consumers, FIs and FinTechs — has helped facilitate an array of innovations, among them real-time payments. As “How Fraud Fears Impact FIs’ Adoption of Faster Payment Solutions” found, nearly half of financial institution (FI) executives say the risk of fraud now outweighs any rewards open banking might offer.",negative,0.94,"search engine, fraud prevention, globe, U.S, divergence, informs, banking, faster payments, FinTechs, Facebook Marketplace, Hawk AI, fraud, survey, digital, bank, many, time, FI, executives, AUM, AI, Industrywide, Samsung Pay, PYMNTS Intelligence, Marketplace, payments, Facebook, institutions, financial institution, Apple Pay, open",2024-03-14,171.13,0.0
