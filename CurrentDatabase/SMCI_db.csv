  Successful Trading is About Having an Edge Over a Series of Trades
  Peter Brandt's motto is: “Strong opinions, weakly held.”
  New investors are typically unconcerned with the investing process and want to focus on finding a “hot” stock pick. The truth is that one investor can be long while another investor is short, and they can both be correct (due to differing time frames)! Simply put, investors should look for stocks showing unusual divergence versus the general market (this works especially well in down markets because RS names are easier to identify).

'It's called exhaustion,' analyst says in wake of frenzied rally

Nvidia Corp.'s stock has been nearly invincible lately, and initially seemed on track Friday to log its seventh straight session of gains - before a dramatic reversal lower.

 The last time Nvidia's stock (NVDA) was up at least 5% intraday but ended the session more than 5% lower was June 9, 2017, when it rose as much as 5.4% but finished off 6.5%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

 While shares of chip companies Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) opened Friday's session lower - after their earnings reports last night showed pressure in segments unaffected by artificial intelligence - other chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) saw positive momentum shortly after the open.

 But the broader chip sector moved lower mid-morning, and all 30 members of the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX ended the session in the red for the first time since Jan. 3, according to Dow Jones Market Data. ""

He added that investors should keep in mind that Nvidia and other AI-darling stocks in the chip sector ""cannot trade up every single day,"" as they seemingly and unnaturally have been lately.

2024-03-11,"Broadcom reported strong Q1'24 with 34% YoY revenue growth, driven by data center and hyperscaler demand for AI infrastructure.
  Given the firm's central role in data center software and now a hyperconverged spectrum of infrastructure, I believe Broadcom will realize significant strength in eFY24 as companies scale their infrastructure to cater to AI capabilities. Looking across Broadcom's operations, aside from AI-related semiconductors, Broadcom experienced a significant pullback in revenue generation across some segments while others thrived, with server storage down -29% y/y, broadband down -23% y/y, and wireless down -4% y/y. Networking grew by 46% y/y as the firm experienced strength in AI accelerators across their two hyperscale customers. The company expects growth in AI-enabling infrastructure and networking equipment throughout eFY24, while wireless, storage, and broadband segments to be pressured.
   Consensus estimates anticipate growth to moderate in eFY25 as the new revenue base normalizes higher with AI-enabling infrastructure becoming more saturated in the market and less novel.

  About Super Micro Computer Stock
  Founded more than three decades ago in 1993, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) designs and manufactures high-performance, high-efficiency server technology through its server management software and storage systems. SMCI is currently priced at 49.6x adjusted forward EPS, which is a significant premium to rival AI server stocks like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)
  Super Micro Beats on Earnings, Revenue
  That said, SMCI's valuation is supported by its strong fundamentals, as well as its robust growth forecast. However, although the tremendous rally in Super Micro has created enormous wealth for investors, it has raised quite a few concerns that the stock may be overvalued.
  Is SMCI Stock Overvalued?
  One of those skeptics is Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng , who on March 4 started coverage of the stock with a “neutral” rating and a $941 price target - a discount of 18.7% to current levels.
